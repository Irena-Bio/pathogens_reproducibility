Project: Pathogen community analysis
Version: v1.0.0

Overview
This archive contains the data tables and R scripts used to generate all figures of bacterial (human, fish/animal, plant) and eukaryotic pathogen abundances across sampling sites.

Folder structure

* data_raw/
  Original exported abundance tables used in the manuscript (Excel/CSV), including:

  * Human_bacterial_pathogens.xlsx
  * Fish_bacterial_pathogens.xlsx
  * Plant_bacterial_pathogens.xlsx
  * Average_abundances_of_pathogenic_species_per_site.csv

* scripts/
  R scripts to reproduce all plots exactly as they appear in the manuscript:

  * Human pathogenic bacteria — barplots.R
    (stacked bar plot of absolute abundance of human bacterial pathogens by site)
  * Fish animal pathogenic bacteria — barplots.R
    (stacked bar plot of absolute abundance of fish/animal bacterial pathogens by site)
  * Plant pathogenic bacteria — barplots.R
    (stacked bar plot of absolute abundance of plant bacterial pathogens by site)
  * euk_pathogens_R.R
    (stacked bar plot of absolute abundance of eukaryotic pathogen species by site)

* figures/
  Output figures (PNG) generated by the scripts above.

* session-info/
  R session information and package citations:

  * sessionInfo.txt          (output of sessionInfo())
  * key_packages.bib         (BibTeX entries for R and the main R packages used)

* LICENSE
  License for reuse.

* README.md
  This file.

Software environment
All analysis and plotting were performed in R (>= 4.x) using the following packages:

* readxl
* readr
* dplyr
* tidyr
* ggplot2
* forcats
* patchwork
* scales
* stringr

Reproducing the figures

1. Open R (version 4.x or later).
2. Install the required packages if needed:
   install.packages(c("readxl","readr","dplyr","tidyr","ggplot2","forcats","patchwork","scales","stringr"))
3. Set the working directory to the top-level folder "pathogens_reproducibility_v1.0.0".
4. Run each script in scripts/:

   * Run "Human pathogenic bacteria — barplots.R" to generate the human-pathogen figure panels.
   * Run "Fish animal pathogenic bacteria — barplots.R" to generate the fish/animal pathogen figure panels.
   * Run "Plant pathogenic bacteria — barplots.R" to generate the plant pathogen figure panel.
   * Run "euk_pathogens_R.R" to generate the eukaryotic pathogen figure panel.
5. Each script will read the corresponding table(s) in data_raw/ and write PNG files to figures/.

Notes

* The site names used in the plots are: "Krka - water", "Krka - sediment", "Kupcina - water", "Kupcina - sediment", and "Fish farm water".
* Bar plots are generated as stacked columns, using absolute abundance values (not percentages) unless otherwise stated inside the script.
* The plotting scripts also define figure tags (A, B, C, D, E) used in the manuscript.

Reproducibility
The exact R session info and package versions used for figure generation are provided in session-info/. These should be cited or archived together with this bundle (e.g. Zenodo DOI) for full reproducibility.
